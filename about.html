  </div>
  My concept from my website comes from a project and hobby me and my brother and his friend had back in 2014. 
  We had the idea to have our own clothing line although i wasnt a major member of the project at the time i was still involved. The designs were things we thought about and then my brothers friend designed them all. I was particularly involved because i love business and i want to be an enterpreneur. I had the designs, logos and content to build the website which made things easier for me. The brief given to us asked us to pick a client or make it about ourselves so i decided to combine both and make the website about the clothing brand me, my brother and his friend designed and thought about. When i started the project i researched on shopping sites like size.com, end.com, vans.co.uk and nike.co.uk.

  My website design was a walk in progress as i had to research on othr sites and having done that i found out that most of them use a white background but i decided to use one of my clients images as the background image. They all had a color scheme and a particular font family and i decided to do the same thing with my website. As a result of the research i gathered all the information i needed and i knew that i would enjoy working on this project . I also knew i had the relevant skills to complete this project. As i said earlier i am familiar with the topic i choose and i knew i had to decelope a new style so it fits my clients requirements. I choose to use a particular color scheme white and a certain shade of the color yellow for text and headings, dark grey for my navbar and a unique shade of red for my button matching the background image. The style i choose to use incoorperated the style of my client's brand. The colors i choose for this project complete each other as we can see that the background image of the website is made of a particular shade of red and yellow which i decided to use as part of my color scheme. In addition to that the color gray used for the navbar is effecient and looks good and the transparent gray container used to hold details for my hoe page helps to blend everything in.

  </div> 
  In developing my website i had to firts learn alot using codeacademy about different html tags and css codes to help me develope my website properly. After completing all the necessarry course i moved on to start working on my website during this time i was also using w3schhols.com to help me in learning how to add features like favicon, multipage, iframe and so many other designs. I used google fonts to get an appropriate font for my website. I made use of java script wheni was inputing my gallery s i decided to make my images in my gallery using a lightbox. I also made use of bootstrap in inputing my form for people to subscribe to my website in my contact page . In the begining of my development i was going to use bootstrap for my navbar but instead i decided to make it myself and ofcourse i had issues but i had to re watch tutorials to implement my navbar. Implementing my form was also a problem for me as i was using css at the time to design it myself and it wasn't meeting the client's requirements so i had to go on boostrap and edit it with my own designs to make it my own and implement it in my website. Having to change some aspects of the website and resolve the issues i had has helped to learn how to fix this issues when creating any other website in the future and also how to use some certain css properties properly like margin, float, padding, width and height.

  </div>
  In my testing phase i had to first make sure that my website was displaying properly on different websites, tablets and phones. I was able to do this by learning how to effeciently use media queries. After applying the media queries i went to github and put my website there for testing on different browsers and where ever i had problems i noted it and went back to fix it so it displayed properly on each type of browser and platform.
